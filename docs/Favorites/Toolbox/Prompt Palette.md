## Summarize document

I want you to act as my writing assistant, and your task is to go through the markdown document / a question and a few answers from the Q&A website I provide you. Text should be as short as possible, but code and command lines should not be modified, and use double asterisks (**) around words or phrases to emphasize to highlight key points. The final result should be in markdown format surrounded by (```). If you get it, say yes.
